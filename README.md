1) REMD_setup: contains input files needed to set up each of the REMD simulations conducted 
2) scripts: contains scripts I used to set up and initiate the REMD simulations and produce the figures in the manuscript 
3) datasets: contains datasets (e.g. radius of gyration across time, dihedral angles sampled) extracted from the simulation using GROMACS' post-processing tools
